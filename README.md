# Time-Series-Decomposition
### Time Series Decomposition, detrending, De-seasoning using Python
#### In this section, i have tried to use all techniques for detrending, de-seasoning and decompositing time-series component.
- Detecting Trends and Detrending  
- Pandas Differencing 
- SciPy Signal
- HP Filters (Hodrick-Prescott)
- Detect Sesoanlity and Deseasoning
- Multiple Box Plots
- Auto-Correlation Plot
- Detecting Cyclical Component
- Residuals, Error
- Time Series Decomposition, why?
- Additive Model
- Multiplicative Model
- Stationarity Checks?
